This project includes 3 modules:

1. Fetching-service: this service monitors the FOREX rate from eodhistoricaldata.com, if the rate that user subscribed get change, then the service send message to RabbitMQ.

2. MQ: this module is RabbitMQ, we can get image from docker hub.

3. Sending-service: this service is message consumer that monitors RqbbitMQ, then send mail to customer about FX rate changes.

**Fectching-service:**
- This service gets rate data  every minutes, as a scheduled job, and can be change execution time in a application.properties

- This module will save the last time rate in the cache, so it can be compared with new rate, if they are not same, then service send new value to MQ.

- The api_token, fetching data link and FX currency can be edited in properties file. the fetching link stored in cacheï¼Œin order to avoid of assembling the link every time.

**Sending-service**

- this module gets the topic message from MQ and send email to customer with attached csv file.

- The customer email address can be edited in properties file and smtp, mail account, password can also be modified in application properties file.

- Logs and  attached file are located outside of application jar, they are easy to be viewed and modified.
